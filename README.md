### Backend:
1. Set up a MySQL database and run table creation commands, trigger creation command, and load with sample data.

2. Run a Redis server
   Products are stored in Redis (shopping cart) as a 'Sorted Set'

   ex.
      member:   "productId:name:price" <br />
      score:    2 <br />

3. Install all node packages with
```
$ npm install
```

4. Run api
```

```

NOTE: Change MySQL and Redis port and host in Express code as needed.
